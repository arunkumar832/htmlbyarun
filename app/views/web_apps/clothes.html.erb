  <td>Clothing (also known as clothes and attire) is fiber and textile material worn on the body. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted
    to human beings and is a feature of nearly all human societies. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on body type, social, and
    geographic considerations. Some clothing can be gender-specific.

    Physically, clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, and can enhance safety during hazardous activities
    such as hiking and cooking. It protects the wearer from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns and prickles
    by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions. Further, they can provide
    a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation.
    Wearing clothes is also a social norm, as being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing, or not wearing clothes in public
    to the extent that genitals, breasts or buttocks are visible could be seen as indecent exposure.</td>
